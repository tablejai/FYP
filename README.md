# FYP Control remote devices with air gestures

This project develops a smart glove that can control electronic devices wirelessly. We have designed a physical smart glove embedded with sensors and wireless communication technologies. The data collected from the smart glove will be transmitted to a server that is capable of processing the sensor data and classify these time-series data into pre-defined gestures with machine learning. These gestures can then be sent to application and perform the task we intended with the gesture in an intuitive way. The project includes several applications to demonstrate the capabilities of the system, including control of PowerPoint and LED control using gestures received.


## Submodules
1. FYP-Glove: communication between the glove and the server, imu driver, and compass
2. FYP-Server: the server for fyp pipeline
